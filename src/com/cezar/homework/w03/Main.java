 * Create a small application that mimics a library catalog. It needs to be able to add books, delete books and list books.
 * Books are of two kinds: novels and art albums. They both have names and number of pages. Novels have type (like mystery, sf, etc.)
 * while albums have paper quality.
 *
 * Model these entities (book, novel, album) with different classes and inheritance.
